A simple pong game made using Verilog

I only uploaded the source files seperately, as Vivado's file structure would have made this more complicated than it should be.

This program is implemented on a Nexys4DDR FPGA board. It outputs a VGA signal to display the game on a moniter, and the paddle is controlled by the buttons on the FPGA board. The counter that is displayed only counts the misses you make, and only resets once it reaches 100.
